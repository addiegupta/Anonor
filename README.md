# xCall
An Android app using Sinch API and Firebase to connect with and talk to random people!

xCall uses a combination of Sinch API for VoIP, Firebase Database and Cloud Functions as a server and a client Android app to form an anonymous voice calling platform in which users can connect with strangers using the app!

The app is available on the Play Store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.addie.xcall

## Features

• SOCIALISE: Connect with a totally random stranger and talk to them and make new friends! 

• STAY ANONYMOUS: No login is required in xCall and the only data being stored in our database is a token generated on your device to connect calls so your identity is completely secure!

• REPORT PROBLEMS: Had problems with the call or the person you just talked to? Give us feedback from within the app!
